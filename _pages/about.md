I'm Zahra Atashgahi. Currently, I'm a Ph.D. candidate at University of Twente, Data Management & Biometrics (DMB) group. During my Ph.D., I focus on Deep Learning and, particularly, sparse neural networks. I seek to develop algorithms to solve different tasks efficiently in terms of computational costs and data requirements.
